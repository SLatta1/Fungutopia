# Fungutopia
This is a code that I wrote as part of my Udacity Data Analytics Course to complete the first project of the program.


# imports
    import pandas as pd
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline
    plt.style.use('seaborn')
# Data sets
The data used to complete this program were collected from the Udacity site through an SQL data base. The following data frames were, City_list.txt, temp.txt and Global_data.txt
